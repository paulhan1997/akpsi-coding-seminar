# Welcome to Paul's AKPsi Coding Seminar

## Getting Started
There are two sessions that you can attend every week. One on **Wednesdays at 7:00PM**, and the other on **Thursdays at 5:00PM**. This seminar is a series that will cover **HTML, CSS and Javascript**.

## Prerequisites
This is an introductory course that requires no prior knowledge or experience in programming. All I ask is that you come with **Sublime Text 3** installed.

You can install Sublime Text at [this link](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
